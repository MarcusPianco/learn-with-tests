## A great Idea
Study js with tests mechanism :)!!!
In each function created exist a comment with complexity of the algoritms.

## To run
1) clone the project: execute in the terminal(unix platform) `git clone https://github.com/MarcusPianco/learn-with-tests.git`sh
2) Open the project folder: `cd learn-with-tests`sh
3) Execute `yarn`sh in the terminal 
4) To run the tests just execute `yarn test`sh in the terminal(unix platform)
obs:.The test command is execute in `--watch` mode, if you need to change this, please change the ..."scripts": "test --watch"... property
in the package.js file and eraser the flag `--watch`.
## Array
Sice create at remove and add element in any position.
