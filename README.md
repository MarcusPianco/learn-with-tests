## A great Idea
Study js with tests mechanism üòç !!!
In each function created exist a comment with complexity of the algoritms.

## To run
1) Clone the project: execute in the terminal(unix platform) `git clone https://github.com/MarcusPianco/learn-with-tests.git`
2) Open the project folder: `cd learn-with-tests`
3) Execute `yarn` in the terminal 
4) To run the tests just execute `yarn test` in the terminal(unix platform)
obs:.The test command is execute in `--watch` mode, if you need to change this, please change the ..."scripts": "test --watch"... property
in the package.js file and eraser the flag `--watch`.
## Array
Creation, remotion of element in any position, sortd elements, find elements, map, filter, find, findIndex, localeCompare, push, pop and etc...
### Contribution
Help is the most beautiful form of friendship.
